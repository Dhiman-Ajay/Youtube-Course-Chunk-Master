#### How it Helps:

Chunking: Automatically divides the video timeline into smaller, manageable time chunks (e.g., 5 minutes).

Visual Progress: Adds clear markers to the YouTube progress bar showing chunk divisions and your completion status (‚úÖ Completed / ‚è≥ To Do).

Interactive Task List: An overlay displays all chunks as a task list, allowing you to see your progress and jump directly to specific sections.

Progress Saving: Automatically saves how many chunks you've completed for each video you add to your list.

Video Watch List: Add videos you plan to watch to a persistent list within the extension popup.

Completion Estimates: Set a daily watching goal (in minutes) and see an estimated number of days to complete videos in your list.

Reminders: Opt-in for daily browser notifications to remind you to continue watching videos from your list.

Customization: Adjust the chunk duration and your daily goal via the popup settings.

Dark Mode: Includes a dark mode theme for the popup interface.

Stop letting long videos intimidate you. Install YouTube Course Chunk Master and start learning consistently!

## Important Notes / Known Issues

*   **Initial Chunk Loading:** Occasionally, the chunk markers and task list might not appear when a video page **first loads**. This seems related to the timing of YouTube's player initialization.
    *   **‚û°Ô∏è Solution:** If you encounter this, simply **refreshing the browser tab** (Ctrl+R / Cmd+R or F5) should resolve the issue and load the chunks correctly.

*   **Reminders Require Chrome:** The daily reminder notifications rely on the Chrome browser's internal scheduling (`chrome.alarms` API). Therefore, reminders **can only trigger if Chrome is running** at the scheduled time. If the browser is closed, the notification for that specific time will be missed. *(The next reminder will be scheduled for the following day as usual)*.
